# Phishing_URL_Detection
Phishing_URL_Detection using Deep Learning
# Problem Statement
Phishing URLs are crafted to deceive users into revealing sensitive information. Traditional detection methods struggle to keep up with evolving phishing tactics, making advanced, adaptive approaches essential.

# Objective
This project aims to develop a deep learning-based system to accurately classify URLs as phishing or legitimate. The system is implemented in Python and integrated into a user-friendly web application for real-time URL checking, prediction, and user feedback.

# Scope
Dataset: Sourced from Kaggle, featuring URL characteristics like length, hostname, and special character counts.
Model: A deep learning model is trained to classify URLs with high accuracy.
Web Application: A user interface allows URL input, prediction, feedback, and access to detailed URL information.
# Methodology
Dataset: Raw URLs are preprocessed to extract features such as URL length, hostname length, and special character counts.
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, feature selection, and handling class imbalance with SMOTE.
Deep Learning Model: A Sequential model with Dense layers using ReLU and sigmoid activation functions is trained with binary cross-entropy loss and the Adam optimizer.
Learning Process: The model learns from patterns in the data and applies them to classify new URLs.
# Model Performance
The model achieves approximately 80% accuracy, demonstrating better performance than traditional methods.

# Web Application Features
URL Input & Prediction: Users can input URLs and receive predictions.
User Feedback: Users can mark URLs as phishing or legitimate, updating local databases.
Additional Information: Access domain and URL details for informed decisions.
# Conclusion
This project successfully developed a phishing URL detection system, providing users with a powerful tool to identify and guard against phishing attempts. The combination of deep learning techniques and a user-friendly interface offers a robust solution to evolving phishing threats.

# Future Scope
Continuous integration of new data and automated retraining.
API endpoints for URL submissions and database updates.
Exploration of advanced model architectures like CNNs or RNNs.
Implementation of real-time feedback mechanisms.
